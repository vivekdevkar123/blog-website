            An important aspect of data science is visualising the data. When we have a fairly large set of data that we
            cannot comprehend only by going through it, we need to plot them in different formats to understand better.
            Visualisation packages make this job a lot easier for data scientists.
            <br>
            This article will talk about seven Python visualisation packages that you must try to plot your data. We
            have excluded Matplotlib from the list as it is fairly common and used by all data science enthusiasts. <br><br>

            <h2>1. Bokeh</h2>
            <br>
            Bokeh is a native Python library that is based on The Grammar of Graphics (Statistics and Computing). This
            library can be used to generate graphs that can easily be imported as JSON objects or HTML documents, so it
            can easily be used on a webpage. <br>
            Also, the visualisations are interactive in nature, i.e., you can get specific information about specific
            parts of the graph easily.
            <br><br>
            Run the following command to install Bokeh. 
            <i>pip install bokeh</i> <br><br>

            <h2>2. Seaborn</h2>
            <br>
            Seaborn is a visualisation library built on top of Matplotlib. That is why you can access almost all
            functionalities of metrics live but with fewer lines of code and more aesthetically pleasing graphs. <br>
            As Seaborn is based on Matplotlib, a good understanding of Matplotlib will be very useful to get more out of
            it. <br><br>
            Run the following command to install Seaborn.
            <br>
            <i> pip install seaborn</i> 
            <br><br>

            <h2>3. ggplot</h2>
            <br>
            Just like Bokeh, this library is based on The Grammar of Graphics, but the operation is slightly different
            from that of the other libraries. Using the ggplot library you can add multiple component layers to get a
            final version of your visualisation. 
            <br>
            To get the most out of it, keeping the data in data frames is advised, as according to the official
            documentation,<b>ggplot has a symbiotic relationship with pandas.</b>
            <br><br>
            Run the following command to install ggplot.
            <i>pip install –U ggplot</i> 
            <br>

            <p>You can learn more about ggplot in its <a href="https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/" target="_blank">official Python documentation.</a> </p>
            

            <br><br>
            <h2>4. Plotly</h2>
            <br>

            Plotly is a bit different from the other packages, as it is a web-based toolkit. But it can also be accessed
            from a Python notebook using its API.
            <br>
            This package has some great visualisation features, like box plots and contour multiple-axis plots, and the
            plots are also interactive in nature.
            <br><br>

            You can run the below command to install it.
            <i>pip install plotly=5.1.0</i>

            <br><br>
            <h2>5. Altair</h2>
            <br>

            This Python visualisation library is based on powerful Vega and Vega-Lite visualisation grammar. It is a
            declarative statistical visualisation library, i.e., we need to declare only the links between the data
            columns (x-axis, y-axis, colour, etc.) and the rest of the work will be done automatically. 
            <br>
            This makes the plotting process easier and also takes fewer lines of code. Also, the plots can be made
            interactive.
            <br><br>
            You can run the below command to install it.
            <i> pip install altair vega_datasets</i>

            <br><br>
            <h2>6. Geoplotlib</h2>
            <br>

            Geoplotlib is a dedicated Python toolbox for the visualisation of geographical data. This toolbox can be
            used for dealing with maps and region-based data, like population, heatmaps, climate, etc. To use this
            toolkit, one needs to install NumPy and pyglet.
            <br><br>

            You can run the below command to install it.
            <i>pip install geoplotlib</i> 

            <br><br>
            <h2>7. Missingno</h2>
            <br>

            One of the biggest headaches of data scientists while working with data is data missing from data sets.
            These missing values should be handled properly for a better analysis of the data. missingno is a Python
            library that helps you visualise the missing data in a pandas data frame.
            <br>
            It helps us to determine the frequency for the position of the missing values in a data set, which can be
            really helpful for data scientists.
            <br><br>

            You can run the below command to install it.
            <i>pip install missingno</i>

            <br><br>
            <h3>Conclusion :</h3>
            <br>

            In this article, we have described seven Python visualisation libraries or toolkits that we can use for
            better and faster visualisation of data.
            <br><br>
            The question “why do we need so many plotting libraries when we have the powerful Matplotlib?” arises. The
            answer is the diversity that these libraries offer.
            <br><br>
            Each library has its own advantages which, if properly used, can give better results than the standard
            libraries. For a detailed overview, you can refer to the official documentation of these libraries.
